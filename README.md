# CSharp-Programs
Here, you'll find some of the basic programs written in C#.
1. GuessingGameUsingWhileLoop - In this program, I've made a small and easy game to guess a word. In this sample, you have 5 tries to guess a secret word (hence the variable 'secretWord'). The word in this sample is 'csharp'. If you guess it correctly, a text "You Win!" gets displayed. If you aren't able to guess the word in 5 tries, a message "You Lose! (Out of guesses)" gets displayed(Used an if-else for this).
